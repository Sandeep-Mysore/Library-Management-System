Library Management System

Domain: Modelling and Design

Technologies & Concepts: OOMD (Object Oriented Modelling and Design), Use Case, Sequence, Activity model, State model

The purpose of this project was to apply Object Oriented Modelling and design principles in the everyday working of a library. This, in process, allows us to combine data structure and user behaviour to objectively analyse and design a more efficient Library Management System with a reduction in complexity.
Analysed the functioning of a typical library.
Built user-profiles for a typical Library Management System.
Modelled and designed the activity cycle diagram and the sequence diagram for the use of the system.
Designed the use-case diagram for the user profiles.
Designed the Class model and Stack model.
